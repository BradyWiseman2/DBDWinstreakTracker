This project is an application for keeping track of winstreaks in a game called Dead By Daylight, and as such may not make perfect sense without knowledge of the game. I made this project for two main reasons,
first being that other community made tools were becoming outdated, and the second reason being that despite taking several classes heavily involving windows forms, I never really felt like I truly got to use the winforms format to its potential.
(Many of my previous projects using winforms instead revolved around using as few winforms elements as possible, see ITEC225 or DesertBusMode7 for a good example)

The main purpose for this application is for tracking winstreaks with more complicated conditions than simply winning over and over. For instance, one mode allows for two players to play the 2v8 mode with randomly assigned characters. To achieve this,
much of the data from the game itself has been included with this program, such as characters, perks, and UI, imported from an API, then modified by myself to suit the needs of this program.

Future TODO:
More UI improvements
More modes
Match history within Streaks
Overall stats based on all Streaks within a category
